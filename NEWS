-----------------

- Performance improvements.
  - Removed needless checks for file existence.
  - Parallel initialization of archives in galaxy mode.
  - Browser won't do things twice (e.g. thread list redraw).
  - Browser will calculate top and bottom message index without screen
    redraw.

-----------------

- Qt browser has been removed.
- Use robin hood hashing for Message ID/lexicon/galaxy data.
  - Disk space requirements have been reduced.
  - Data access pattern is now linear, which increases speed of operation,
    especially due to reduction of page fault rate.
  - These changes require removal of lexopt utility and merge of lexhash into
    lexicon utility.
- Use custom string compression algorithm for Message IDs. This results in
  nearly 50% disk space savings.
- Improvements in extract-msgid utility:
  - Relaxed Message ID validation. If a non-confirming ID can be handled
    without any hassle, it is.
  - Message ID scanning procedure is much stricter now.
    - Scan is only performed in headers block.
    - Message ID now must be in the same line as the 'Message-ID:' field
      header.
  - Completely broken Message IDs, or messages without the 'Message-ID:' field
    are now assigned a custom, unique Message ID.
- The same Message ID validation is also performed in kill-duplicates utility.
- Improvements in filter-spam utility:
  - Zstd data is now also filtered, if present. LZ4 data is still required.
  - Optional mode for filtering against message size.
  - Optional mode for filtering messages by provided Message ID list.
  - Optional mode for threaded spam removal.
  - Replaced libcrm114 spam classificator with terminator library.
  - Display Message ID and date in spam training mode.
  - Increase message preview size in spam training mode.

  - Very long (more than 1024 characters) message lines are now properly
    handled.
  - Add decorations to *bold*, _underlined_ and /italics/ text segments.
  - Add decorations to URLs.
  - "Go to message" functionality now accepts negative numbers to go to the
    most recent messages.
  - Group activity chart has been added.

    can handle them.
- Improvements in verify utility:
  - Check if all messages can be accessed using their Message IDs.
  - Display info if lexicon distance data is missing.
- Check for empty 'Subject:' field in extract-msgmeta utility.
- Extraction of parent message from 'References:' field is now more relaxed.
- Improvements to time stamp handling:
  - While 'Received:' field exists primarily in mailing list messages, usenet
    messages use 'NNTP-Received-Date:' or 'Injection-Data:' headers. These are
    now also handled.
  - Validate date against all server date headers, not only the first one.
- Multi-threaded compression in repack-lz4 utility.
- Improved memory efficiency of small temporary allocations in various
  utilities.
- Improvements in threadify utility:
  - Multi-threaded message matching.

- Add nntp-get utility.
- Further speed improvements in lexdist utility.
- Store levenshtein distance in lexdist data. Use this information to modify

  is a reply sent to group A to a message sent to group B. This is not a
  crosspost, but messages obviously should be cross-referenced.
- Text mode browser improvements:
  - Internal changes to message buffer ownership, resulting in decreased
    memory usage and fixing of a nasty bug.
  - Support for filtering in galaxy archive open list. Requires further work.
  - Search results now can be sorted by date in ascending or descending order.
    The default order is still determined by search score.
  - Search results preview now displays properly formatted message context and
    highlights most relevant search terms.
  - Display 'to:' field, which is used instead of 'newsgroups:' in mailing
    list messages.

  - The 'wrote' message preamble is now detected heuristically and assigned
    its own lexicon context type.
  - Speed optimization (at the cost of memory).
  - Words existing in only one message are no longer stored in lexicon.
- Changes in threadify utility:
  - Search context has been limited to 16 lines.
  - Don't check for matches in low-ranked messages.
  - Only match messages that are in a reasonable chronological order.
- Improve end-of-message detection in import-source-mbox utility.
- Handle messages without 'subject:' field. Such messages are conforming to
  RFC requirements.
- Improvements to time stamp handling:
  - Search for date in 'received:' field, if the message contains malformed
    'date:' field. Still try to parse the 'date:' field, if search fails.
  - Detect time traveling messages ('date:' and 'received:' fields too far
    apart in time).
- Bump package version to 2.
  - Store list of subject prefixes common to the archive.
  - Additional lexicon context types invalidate old lexicon data.

    archive selection from a list, not by file name.
  - Unique Message ID collection lists all messages in all archives.
  - Each message is assigned to one or more archives.
  - Browser can display crossposts.
