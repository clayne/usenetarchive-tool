.SH NAME
uat-libuat - UAT library
.SH DESCRIPTION
libuat is a library used to interact with UAT archives. It provides two
major functionality groups: archive access and state tracking.
.SS Archive access
Archive access is realized through
.I \%Archive
class, which provides various methods to access archive's internal
databases. Each archive consists of a number of messages (also referred to
as "articles"). These messages can be accessed using either numerical index,
or unique textual message identifier (Message-ID). Using Message-IDs
involves hash-map lookup step to translate them into message indexes.

Each archive may also contain the following metadata:
.IP \[bu] 2
archive name \- typically source usenet group, for example
.I comp.os.linux
.IP \[bu]
short description \- short information about purpose of the group (per RFC
3977, 7.6.6).
.IP \[bu]
long description \- group charter. (Some newsgroups regularly post a
description to the group that describes its intention. These descriptions
are posted by the people involved with the newsgroup creation and/or
administration. If the group has such a description, it almost always
includes the word "charter", so you can quickly find it by searching the
newsgroup for that word. A charter is the "set of rules and guidelines"
which supposedly govern the users of that group.)
.SS State tracking
Information such as last opened archive, a list of previously viewed messages
and whether any message was visited in the past are provided by the
.I \%PersistentStorage
class.
