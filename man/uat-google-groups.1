.SH NAME
uat-google-groups \- crawl Google Groups and save messages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.I uat-google-groups
<group name>
.SH DESCRIPTION
This utility will crawl Google Groups content and save messages in maildir
format.

It will create one directory per group, one subdirectory per thread and one
file per message.

Crawling threads and messages is performed using 32 download threads to
achieve reasonable levels of speed. Additionally, thread list is
speculatively crawled on 8 download threads with 100 message threads per
page. This is done to lessen the impact of reply slowdown on further pages.
.SH NOTES
Downloaded messages are encoded in UTF-8, even if \%Content-Type headers tell
otherwise. This is limitation of Google Groups.

Based on https://github.com/henryk/gggd.
